URSA is a ECS framework integrated into Unity.
It doesn't use a separate backend, and works on top of unity components in a very simple manner.
URSA streamlines typically complex gamedev tasks like managing initialization sequences and serialization, as
well as being a fully fledged ECS it completely decouples systems and forces data driven approach.

* AssetImporters
* AssetTools
* Blueprints
* Configs
* Console
* Database
* Debug
* ECS framework
* Levels System
* PersistentData system
* Reactive Variables
* Save System

And other tools and utilities.

URSA uses same basic classes over all systems, creating unified environment.
These classes are

* ComponentBase
* SerializedData

Every feature is built around the usage of the same classes, minimizing complexity.
